# DIY Project
This was a project created for a software development class. 
We made an app that stored DIY Projects for a client that allowed them to import and export projects, remove projects, edit materials, and add projects. 

## Magic Conch Shell 
Our team name came from the Spongebob Squarepants episode where Spongebob pulled a conch shell and him and his friend Patrick relied on this Magic Conch Shell to make decisions. We thought it was quirky. There was no real reason behind the name. 

## The Project 
Our instructor gave us a scenario where we interviewed with a client and made user stories based off of what the user wanted. 
We were to choose 4 user stories and create our app around those in the 7 weeks we were allotted during the quarter. Our team had weekly meetings, met up to work on code, and had lunch together to create productivity. 
We were able to create a fully functional app to store DIY Projects together. I worked on handling the materials, so as you can see in my specific fork, I was able to create the back end to add materials, and created the front end to add/edit materials. I also completed a JUnit test for my other team members.
